             Dennis Mcalistair Ritchie was an american computer scientist.Also commonly known by his user name dmr.Born in 1941,ritchie died in 2011 a week later than Steve Jobs.He is the father of the C programing language,which even today is the base of many programs,smartphones and operating systems.He is the co-creator of Unix operating system with Ken Thompson.
         Dennis Mcalistair Ritchie was born in Bronxville,New York.His father was Alistair E. Rithie who is a long time Bell Lab scientist. Alistair E. Rithie also co-writer of ''Design of Switching Circuits''.He moved with his family to Summit,New Jersey as a child.He graduated from Summit High School.He graduated from Harward University whith degrees in physics and applied mathematics.
 DEVELOPMENT OF UNIX AND C
            Orgin of Unix goes back to 1960s. It was before microchips and personal computers had been invented.It was started as Multics.General Electronics,Bell Labs,MIT worked on computer utulity that would provide support for several hundred user at the same time.Bell Labs was responsible for operating system.Rithie joined to the project at Bell Labs in 1967.But Multics was in crysis when he arrived.Every big software project was in crysis at the time.People realized how writing large programs diffucult and costly. In 1969 Bell Labs pulled out of the project.
         Ritchie and another lead programer from the same project Ken Thompson wanted to continue their project.But Multics was too complex.So they decided they wanted  to keep things simple.Their idea didn't see support from their maanagers so they start looking for an obsolete computer to build their system they called UNIX.The machine had just 16 kilobyte memory but that was eneught to keep things simple and build the system.They finished the first prototype in a few months and present it to their coworkers and managers.They still remain unconvinced but Thompson and Ritche were able persuade Bell Labs to acquaire a full size computer to run UNIX.
        They decided to rewrite UNIX entirely.First UNIX had written in machines native code.It was difficult and slow.So for the next version Ritchie invented a new programming language called C.It bridged the gap between machine code and programming languages.
     C spans back to 1964.CPL(combined programming language)were developed in Cambridge University in London.But CPL didn't survive.One of the development team visited MIT and created a basic version it called BCPL(Basic CPL).Later Thompson and Ritche squized it into 8 bits and called it B when they decided to build UNIX on it.Finally an improved version of this developed by Ritchie which they called C.This made writing software immensely easier and also made software portable.So new version of UNIX completed in 1973 and it was portable thanks to C.
        Bell Lab's parent company AT&T didn't have any interest in UNIX.So Thompsn and Ritchie distributed it to universities,research instutuions free of charge.They loved it clean and economical design.
      Universities began teaching their students UNIX and C programming.And when they gratuated they took this knowledge to industry.In 1978 Ritchie and his colleague  Brian Kerningham wrote a textbook called The C Programming Language which it became best selling primer for 15 years.Book made popular,now obligatory example''Hello World'' which explainns how to create simple program that prints. Brian Kerninghan said that with C "Dennis managed to find a perfect balance between expressiveness and efficiency. It was just right for creating systems programs like compilers, editors, and even operating systems. C made it possible for a 
2
programmer to get close to the machine for efficiency but remain far enough away to avoid being tied to a specific machine... As a result,C became in effect a universal assembler: close enough to the machine to be cost effective, but far enough away that a C program could be compiled for and run well on any machine."
           The combination of UNIX and C is the base of computer programming culture ever since.It's altered versions are still popular today.UNIX as a portable operating system became extremely popular.
    Steve was a UNIX devotee.He created NeXT Workstation on UNIX after he left Apple.And when he came back he brought UNIX and C with him.Now C and UNIX is the base of apples latest products.
  AWARDS
        Ritchie and Thompson received turing award in 1983 for their UNIX operative system.In 1990 they received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from  the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE), for the development of UNIX operative system and C programming language.
       In 1997 both of them  were made Fellows of  the Computer  History Museum for the creation of Unix operative system and development of C programing language.
        April 21 of 1999 Thompson and Rithie received National Medal of Technology from Bill Clinton for co-inventing UNIX operative system and C programming language.Accordind to citation on the medal "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".
        Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie with its achivement award for his contribution to science tecnology and society in general with UNIX operating system and C programming language in 2005.
       Ritchie and Thompson awarded was with  Japan Prize for Information and Communications for their work in the development of UNIX operating system.
         Ritchie was found dead on October 12  2011  at the age of 70 at his own home
